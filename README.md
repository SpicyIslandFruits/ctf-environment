# CTF Environment
## My ctf environment with angr, ghidra, pwntools, gef, gdb-peda, and cutter installed.  
First you need a build environment and docker and xhost(to run gui application inside container).  
So you will want to install build-essentials docker-compose docker xhost.    
Then 'make build' to build image and 'make run' to create the container.
